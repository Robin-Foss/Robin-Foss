      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Depends on the data you are working with]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[Parentheses affect the order for example 2 + 4 * 4 = 14 without parentheses and if you put the parentheses with (2 + 4) * 4 the answer is 20]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[you can limit it with the toFixed method]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[To compare two floating-point numbers in JavaScript, you can check if they are close enough within a small range]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators in JavaScript return a boolean value, which means they return either true or false]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[The Math.random() function in JavaScript generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). 
        This means the result will be a number from 0 up to, but not including, 1.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[The modulus operator (%) in JavaScript returns the remainder of a division operation. 
        For example, 7 % 3 would return 1 because 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1.]
