      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[yes]</p>
      
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
        <p>[As long as the while statement is faLse you will get an infinite loop]</p>

        <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
          number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
          the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
          <p>[Java script is described as single-threaded. Meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. In this while loop, the time it takes to make the statement come true can be as short, and as long amount of time
            as long as the program is running.]</p>

            <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
              change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
              matter?
              ]</li>
            <p>[You can change the order of rows and columns, but it may affect the performance. The concept of "rows" and "columns" is primarily a matter of how you interpret the data structure you're working with]</p>
